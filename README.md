I am a third-year computer science student at PJATK, where I study two specializations: 
- Databases
- Intelligent Data Processing Systems. 
I have programming skills in Java, Python, C#, C++, SQL (T-SQL, PL/SQL).

I am ambitious and determined, I always strive for my goals and never give up. 
I also like working in a team because I am open to other people and I find it easy to build relationships.
